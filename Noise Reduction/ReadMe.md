## Noise Reduction Filters

This floder contains noise reduction algorithim. The recorded noisy data for real situations is also avaiable.  

One Matlab function `mimranh.m` is noise reduction alg based on Spectral Subtraction based on Boll-79  
It includes  
1. Amplitude Spectral Subtraction  
2. Magnitude Averaging  
3. Residual Noise Reduction  

Second Matlab function `Wiener_KIST.m` is based on Wiener Filter.
